Beshari Project Write Up

### Notebook Analysis
#### 1. Run the functions provided in the notebook on test images (first with the test data provided, next on data you have recorded). Add/modify functions to allow for color selection of obstacles and rock samples.
Test Images

A new function was added to the notebook:

~~~python
def color_thresh_rock(img, rgb_thresh=(20, 0, 10)):
    # Create an array of zeros same xy size as img, but single channel
    color_select = np.zeros_like(img[:,:,0])
    # Require that each pixel be above all three threshold values in RGB
    # above_thresh will now contain a boolean array with "True"
    # where threshold was met
    above_thresh = (img[:,:,0] > rgb_thresh[0]) \
                & (img[:,:,1] > rgb_thresh[1]) \
                & (img[:,:,2] < rgb_thresh[2])
    # Index the array of zeros with the boolean array and set to 1
    color_select[above_thresh] = 1
    # Return the binary image
    return color_select
~~~
    

#### 1. Populate the `process_image()` function with the appropriate analysis steps to map pixels identifying navigable terrain, obstacles and rock samples into a worldmap.  Run `process_image()` on your test data using the `moviepy` functions provided to create video output of your result. 

and we got a movie result (Please see in the Output Folder named **test_mapping**

### Autonomous Navigation and Mapping

#### 1. Fill in the `perception_step()` (at the bottom of the `perception.py` script) and `decision_step()` (in `decision.py`) functions in the autonomous mapping scripts and an explanation is provided in the writeup of how and why these functions were modified as they were.


#### 2. Launching in autonomous mode your rover can navigate and map autonomously.  Explain your results and how you might improve them in your writeup.  

**Note: running the simulator with different choices of resolution and graphics quality may produce different results, particularly on different machines!  Make a note of your simulator settings (resolution and graphics quality set on launch) and frames per second (FPS output to terminal by `drive_rover.py`) in your writeup when you submit the project so your reviewer can reproduce your results.**

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
